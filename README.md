## Instagram Analyzer - Python script

Following my passion for Data Science, this repository hosts code that will be used to analyze Instagram.
Data is stored in a (private) MongoDB instance for analysis.

**Ideas include:**
- Prime time to post

- Measuring how interactions and relationships change over time

- Caption generation

- Heat maps that show where friends post the most number of photos

- Search for specific criteria (i.e.: "who went to Oktoberfest in Munich")
